**This is my first developed website, I'm loving my initial step of learning.**

This is basically to showcase my understanding in usage of grid in CSS, this doesn't contain any animations and also this is not responsive so use desktop devices to view the site, We can also make this site responsive with a little planning, but i'm just stopping this here and gonna continue with my learning.
